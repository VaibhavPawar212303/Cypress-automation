Test ID

open the GUI Interface by the Cypress by command
npm run cy:open

I have included 2 test scenarion in the git hub repository.As per the test assingment of the lambdatest

In this repository have created the test spec file in the Integration folder and page model and xpath/id/class in the support folder.
created the class and method and call them in the test spec file you can check.
Both the test senario visit first the website mentioned in the assignment pdf.

first senario move towards the slidebar section a slide the progress bar and check the default value of the slidebar should be 15
then as per on function I have written over their it take the xpath of the range value and change it to the 95.

another one is for filling the form and check the accesibility of it.
I have use the access method for the form and use the lighhouse to check how the page load.
fill the form
I am not sure why the light house plugin is not working in it. I am finding different ways through which i can implement the lighthouse plugin as per the test

I think the close browser method is not supported in the cypress and close session in not demonstrated or tell which to be closed.

Thanks!
